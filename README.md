A choropleth map of Covid-19 cases from 2020-01-21. For the interpolate(t) function I loop over a log(x) range to get better color fitting. This way we can see the change in counties with relatively few cases.  

The data was taken from NYtimes us-counties covid-19 data. Note that New York city county has no data, or has no id to show cases on the map as they are seperated out in the data. To prevent the spread of erroneous information always visit the cdc.gov for relavant information. This app provides a visualiztion into the spread of covid19 in the USA.
